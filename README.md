# Nova Cart

#### Project Exam 1 - Frontend Development

### Nova Cart is a fictional e-commerce platform built as my project exam for the Frontend Development 1 course at Noroff.

This project simulates a real online shopping experience where users can browse products, view details, register, login, and purchase items. It is designed to demonstrate my ability to plan, design, and develop a complete fontend web application connected to a live API.

**The goal of the project is to create a responsive web application where users can:**

- Browse products in a clean and modern interface.
- View detailed information about each product, including reviews and discounts.
- Register and log in to their own account.
- Add products to a cart (when logged in), adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- See a confirmation page after a successful purchase.

**Brand Story**

Nova Cart is a modern, stylish online store that brings together everyday essentials and unique finds. With a playful yet professional brand identity, Nova Cart aims to make online shopping simple, fast, and enjoyable. The clean design and intuitive interface focus on usability, while maintaining a friendly personality that sets it apart from generic e-commerce sites.
